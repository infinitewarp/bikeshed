        <h1>Bikeshed Calculator</h1>
        <p>
            The bikeshed calculator shows you how much money you cost the company by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> a particular discussion. This takes a list of gross annual salaries (obscured by default so you don't expose your wages to others) and a length of time for the discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            These calculations assume that your salaries pay for 40 hours/week for 50 weeks/year and do not account for taxes or withholdings; they are meant to describe the cost to the company.
        </p>
